# File Organizer Script

## Overview

This is a quickly written python script that allows you to organize files in a selected folder based on their extensions. It utilizes the ``Tkinter`` library to provide a graphical user interface for selecting the target folder.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

## Run

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. A Tkinter dialog box will appear. Select the folder containing the files you want to organize.

3. The script will create subfolders based on file extensions and move the files accordingly.

4. Once the organization is complete, a "Done!" message will be displayed.
